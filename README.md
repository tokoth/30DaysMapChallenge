Well it‚Äôs a wrap. Topi Tjukanov's #30DayMapChallenge this year arrived at the perfect time for me. After avidly observing the challenge in 2020 as a spectator, I began preparing the maps as soon as the topic for this year's challenge was released in early October 2021.

Participating in this challenge provided me with an excellent opportunity to learn, and it allowed me to experiment with different mapping approaches and tools, as well as convince/prove my cartographic skillset to myself (and possibly others) in the form of a portfolio. 

Finally, the outpouring of support and gratitude from the mapping community on Twitter was astounding and undoubtedly the most rewarding component of the challenge. I'm glad I joined and will continue to be a member of this community!

Mapping tools and software‚Äôs used; QGIS, ArcGIS Pro, Python, Blender, Aerialod, and GIMP.

[Here](https://twitter.com/tjukanov/status/1443868144905428992) you can find the official list of daily mapping topics, and [here](https://twitter.com/tyson_okoth) is my Twitter profile, where I posted my map creations.

Here is a montage of my maps.
